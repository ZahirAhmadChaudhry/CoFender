This folder is reserved for local static assets.

For this self-contained MVP, the "sample.pdf" has been embedded directly into index.html as a Base64 string to ensure the demo works immediately without worrying about local file path permissions or web server requirements.

If you wish to use a real local PDF:
1. Place a file named 'sample.pdf' here.
2. Edit index.html to point the PDF.js `url` parameter to 'assets/sample.pdf' instead of the Base64 data.
